                "description": "The treehouse could not have lived up to our expectations more. Of course being the 'most wished for' destination, the expectations were pretty high. I think what no one can really explain is the way this place makes you feel. My fianc√© and I really enjoyed being removed from the outside world for a little while and its hard to put into words how wonderful it was to connect with each other without distractions. \n\nWe have stayed in some 'secluded' locations in the past and the hardest thing was finding a place to eat or ordering take out. Because this treehouse is located right in ATL (I know hard to believe and trust me, you will have no idea you are in the city of ATL once you arrive to the treehouse) it was so easy to order pizza, get breakfast and even find things to do. But trust us, you want to spend as much time at he treehouse as you can- you WILL miss it when you get back home. \n\nPeter had the best coffee waiting for us each morning and loved being greeted by his perfect little cat Haskel and dog Daisy. Peter you are a great guy, thanks so much for sharing this place with us. "

It feels like you are in the most beautiful place in the middle of nowhere. The treehouse is the kind you would see on HGTV, Joanna Gaines would be proud. It is the perfect place to find peace, privacy and experience nature at it's finest.\n\nThe icing on top, is the host Peter is an absolute gem. He was so kind and made the stay even more special.\n\nWould recommend this to everyone I know and will most definitely be back in the future.\n\nThis is the place people dream of. "

I came alone because I'm a widow and was hoping I wouldn't regret it but I didn't feel alone.  I (EMAIL HIDDEN)ing from a big city I so needed this.  It showed me that with the everyday loud, constantly rushing world of mine to cover my pain of loosing my husband is not good for me.  Being alone is not always a bad thing.  God has set this path for me and I now need to embrace what my life is now.  This treehouse has given me the peace I have been starving for.  Thanks Peter"

Being outside the boat was tricky with our toddler (he could easily walk under the railings around the edge) but we figured that when we chose this place.  There is a beautiful view of the water and the bridge with gorgeous moon rises at night and sometimes dolphins swimming by.  It was really cool to be on a houseboat so close to downtown and we would certainly do it again!"

Neither my wife nor I could sleep in the bedroom because of the sweltering heat and smell of sewage that always sleeps from the bathroom. For $300+ per night, the sleeping area should be priority number one for the hosts to fix."

They were both very responsive and communicative in advance and during our stay. We loved the hot tub and pool, and only wish the sun would've come out a little more than it did so we could have made more use of them. The yurt was very clean, well stocked with linens, toiletries, games and movies. We would love to come and stay again, for longer next time! Highly recommend. Thank you, Whitt and Martha!"

                "description": "I feel like I could write a book about our (tragically) one-night stay at Paul's Bloomingdale oasis. For a review, however, perhaps a more succinct approach will do. Paul is a host among hosts, and his space is one of the most welcoming and beautiful places that I have ever spent a night in. Honestly, I'm not sure with which to be more impressed with -- the room or the hospitality! Photos of the space give you a good impression, but seeing it in person made me smile from ear to ear. Warm, cozy and perfectly inviting, the space is definitely intimate but more than accommodating  enough for a stay of one night or several.\n\nPaul and his partner have masterfully created both an interior and garden that made me want to stay much longer than we did -- we've even started talking about coming back to DC just to stay there again! A big part of the appeal is his dedication to true hospitality. Welcoming us at our car and introducing us to the apartment, he even had drawn out a map of the neighborhood and drafted a list of his favorite joints, and walked us through both. At breakfast, we ran into him at the local cafe, and it seemed like everyone knew his name -- trust his recommendations. Even down to his clear love and inherent dedication to the people and history of the area, Paul is pushing to the boundaries of hospitality, in the most beautiful of ways."

They had a map of the area drawn out as well as a comprehensive list of all the great local spots which was extremely helpful. Its about a 15 min walk to the closest metro but my boyfriend and I mostly used uber/lyft (approx. $6-8 to all the major sites during out time there). The apartment is very small but the homey touches (coffee, tea, bottled water, juice, etc) and the thoughtful decorations made it feel like home. For my boyfriend and myself it was the perfect getaway weekend! We definitely recommend staying here! "

Orondo is simply stunning and the property has incredible mountain and water views. The house itself blew me away - such fantastic attention to detail (for fans and non fans alike) and just a perfectly peaceful, comfortable stay. The bed and fireplace are fantastic. We did not make use of the tub or the woodworking table but appreciated both and all of the little hygge touches! Mostly we sat out on the porch and watched that stunning view - wow! Things to be mindful of: there is no kitchen (pack or pick up en route), power is limited (don't plan to have everything running at once), pack light (the place is cozy and the walk to the front door is steep), and check your pup for ticks if you're traipsing through the wildflowers on the east side of the Cascades :) I would recommend this spot to anyone - reward yourself and book it!"

We didn't do many activities on the island because it was a little cold and rainy, but we did go to the Japanese Garden (highly recommend - it happened to be sunny when we were there and we spent an hour alone in the garden). We also ate at one of the restaurants 'downtown' - can't remember the name, but it looked like a big white house and had a deck out front for outdoor seating. The food was great and locally sourced. Overall, wonderful experience!"

I was traveling alone, but the whole family (I met Rub√©n, Meli y la due√±a de la casa) was welcoming and made me feel at ease. Breakfast was delicious, the space tranquil and with a wonderful view. I would recommend to anyone looking to find peace in Valpo. Muchas gracias por una buena experiencia!"

The touristical area is easily reachable by bus or by a nice walk via Artilleria, from which you will have a great view on the harbour and the city. The only point for improvement could be the cleanliness, since you will share the house with two (beautiful!) cats who won't hesitate to leave their hairs and odor. We would definitly recommend staying in Suite Mirador!"

It's exactly like the photos and we had so much fun cooking on the aga. This house looks like something out of a fairytale and the surrounding landscape is also unbelievably beautiful. \n\nWe walked to some near by waterfalls and they were breathtaking.

All the basic appliances available and the house is small, at the end of a cul-de-sac in a residential area, but really cute, with local architectural features with a very enjoyable outdoor space. Walkable from town centre but a fair 20min on foot up and down hill. Gustavo lives nearby and was available to all our queries. Overall a pleasant stay and would recommend Gustavo and his place when staying in Tiradentes for its good value and a quirky local experience. "

That and paradise must be very similar; my daughters and I were enchanted. The stores can close so you think you are sleeping in a cave with complete darkness and silence. Yet with all the comfort of a modern house. The photos do not give justice to the beauty of the place!!\n\nAlso, Gustavo is a wonderful and kind guest. One thing you need to be sure is to study the map and the location of the house before arriving‚Ä¶obvious but I was relying on my GPS wish was not a good idea! We got lost but we phone Gustavo and he went to meet us downtown to show us the way.  He made us feel like it was our own house. We would definitely recommend this place and would like to rent it for two weeks next time. \n\nMuito obrigado Gustavo. \n"

There is a great Brazilian restaurant, Kitanda, on the corner of the street. Contact before and during the stay was easy, Gustavo lives really close by, and the exchange of keys was easy. We would definitely stay here again. "

The fridge was also stocked with lots of goodies for us, which was very thoughtful, and much appreciated. The apartment is very comfortable and has a great little balcony (no view, but still a nice place to sit). The air conditioning works well, and the wifi was good. The location of the apartment is excellent, close to shops and a couple of minutes walk from beautiful beaches. It felt very safe to us. it was easy to get Ubers to reach any parts of the city we wanted to visit. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay here, and found Lauro a wonderful host. He frequently checked by text that we had all we needed, and sent lots of very useful suggestions for place to visit or eat out. Thoroughly recommended!!"

Because our Portuguese was very limited, we really appreciated that he made himself available to answer questions about suggestions of what to see and how to book travel arrangements like tickets for ferry rides. The websites were difficult to navigate, so his assistance was invaluable. \n\nThe home was well equipped and the photos did a good job showing what it looks like. He even went out of his way to leave some snacks and sundries to welcome us. The apartment is very secure, quiet, and private. It's very close to a supermarket and is in walking distance to a hub of local beachside activity.\n\nAs a gay couple, we found the neighborhood welcoming, safe, and fun. Salvador was wonderful, and we hope to be back soon.\n"

Surrounded by a beautiful garden, comfortable inside and out and fully equipped, it's a perfect place for a holiday in Arraial d'Ajuda. Beaches are nearby (although not walking distance) and the main street it some 10-15 minutes walk away. \n\nMaria Clara and her helper Rosali were extremely helpful throughout, and communication was great before and during the stay.\n\nThe one suggestion for improvement I could make is the installation of wi-fi. Mobile phone signal is good, but roaming charges can be prohibitive in Brazil and getting a local SIM card is far from trivial for foreigners: most providers require registering with a Brazilian identity card and doing it with the passport is not straightforward. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place and would stay again many times."

Our flight was late arriving and we did not have cell service, but he was outside the building waiting for us still anyway, gave us a tour of the place, and was very responsive if/when we had questions. The location was great and the views from the rooftop were amazing! We would definitely stay there again. "

You will have down and up the ramp 7 floors each way.\n\nThe collection of books and the games on the Xbox is marvelous and you could spend hours in the house enjoying the view from the balcony.\n\nTable mountain, V&A waterfront, the airport and camps bay are very close from where you are based so those extra few minutes of snoozing alarms will not make a big difference!\n"

Be sure to read their recommendations for restaurants as they are absolutely correct...The Cousins and Miller's Thumb were outstanding! And Truth Coffee is a block away with great lattes and breakfast. The views of Cape Town are stunning from the outside patio, particularly viewing the night lights of the city. We walked just about everywhere during the day but took Uber once it was dark. Sol and Mike responded quickly to questions we had and were great hosts. We would stay here again if our travels bring us back to Cape Town."

As I traveled alone , it was very important to me to be in a safe Area.Llandudndo is one of the safest Areas around Capetown.Its quiet and guarded 24/7 ...the Beach is beautiful and only a short Walk from the house .... I recommend a car , since the next Supermarket is located in Hout Bay ( a 10 Minute Drive from Llandudno)By the way a wonderful way to practice driving in South Africa on the Left.And now let me finish by saying: Its the most wonderful place to be and the most wonderful people to be with ....and last but not least don't  let me forget ' Max' the Dog.My Soulmate my ' Beach Buddy ' ..... I miss him dearly ! "

                "description": "Villa Ondine is a beautiful, big villa situated at the beach of Kommetjie. The place itself is so lovely we almost didn't want to leave it to visit all the beauty of Capetown. All major attractions can be reached within 45 minutes driving. We spend 6 nights in Ondine with 3 kids of 10, 12 and 13 and managed to see a lot of the major spots while still allowing time to relax in the villa, enjoying the beach, the pool or the terrace. We got a warm welcome by Tim's father Leon who lives in a house adjacent to the villa. The sunset over the Atlantic can be viewed from the beach or terrace and in the distance you can see Hout Bay and the table mountain. The sound of the waves is ever present in the house. The place itself is very large with 2 terraces, 4 twin bedrooms and a large living/dining with open kitchen which is overlooking the atlantic. We felt at home instantaneously and will for sure be back one day."

The lady who came do the cleaning didn't ring at the door she came through the garden and didn't say hello, asking us to finish quickly. same for the men with her.  after was the most that the father of the owner came at 9am (check in at 10) with people (builders) in the garden  and a big big dog who entered in the house!!!  (we have a baby of 5 weeks old who was on seat on the floor and a girl of 3 years old) they didn't say good morning (or sorry) as we were at breakfast!!  the bathroom is open view to the garden and this people came on the bathroom window when my wife was still in the shower !!! Just this feeling you are in their house! Plus for this price please put some lamp/ light on side of the beds and some shampoo/soap in the bathrooms and oil for the kitchen... the house is really nice but some things and services has to be changed for this type of prices.

Arranged for our pick up from and to the ferry and provided a very detailed list of recommendations for shops, attractions and restaurant. Each place we tried based on her list turned out to be a gem and highly ranked in other trusted sites.\r\n\r\nBoth Laskarina and the housekeeper were quick to respond to every assistance request / question we had even on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nI can't think of experiencing Santorini any other way and recommend that you don't pass up the opportunity of staying in this house.

The cave house is in a great location, about 30 meters from the most popular view of the Santorini's famous sunset. The house itself has a spectacular view of the Caldera, like a picture. We spend woderful time at the terrace looking at this view. \nInside the house there was everything we needed. The house was tastefully arranged. After the repairs, there is now a comfortable double bed and a nice toilet. \nWe enjoyed the small details that made our stay more cosy, like a lot of candles or the discs with music selected by Ioannis. \nWe felt in good hands from the moment we arrived to Oia and met Natasha waiting for us. She brought us to the house and immediately Iannis called to explain everything and help us accommodate. He was accessible when we needed help. \nWe enjoyed our stay very much and hope we can come again. \n\n\n"

In fact not just the best but at least twice as good as anywhere else we have rented. Our experience was outstanding: the property, the location and above all the warm welcome and help we received from Dana, Dimitris and Giannis. I hesitate to provide specific details because I feel that if you're looking to stay in Oia you should just click to book and enjoy the experience first-hand. I will say that the view is one of the best anywhere, and that the first thing you will hear in the morning as you sit sipping your coffee on the terrace is the soft click of cameras as the first passing tourists of the day take pictures on the path below. However, they are not taking pictures of the view, but of the steps up to house you are staying in because they look so amazing! Our only regret is that we did not plan to spend longer here. This is an exceptional property and we hope to be lucky enough to return one day."

What makes Antonio's house so special is the private setting with an abundance of fruit trees ( oranges, apricots, cherries, plums), frangrant flowers, fresh vegetables and herbs. Many of these ingredients find their way into his fabulous Sicilian cooking . The 35 Euro we paid for these 7 course dinners was well worth it. Breakfast was also a delight with fresh squeezed juices, local pastries/bread and Antonio's homemade jams.\nThere are two bedrooms, one with a private bathroom and one which has a shared bathroom with the owner.\nAntonio and Sammi were delightful, friendly and  fun. Antonio was very helpful with tips about places to visit and safe driving routes. We truly enjoyed our marvelous Sicilian holiday!\n"

A great chef, a doctor (our children had just been sick so he helped us a lot). The garden was amazing and like an adventure for our 3 year old girl.\n\nA great stay and I would love to try it as a winter retreat as well reading books by the cozy fireplace.\n\nThank you so much!"

He is a great cook and so proud of the Sicilian produce, which mainly comes from his own garden. We were lucky enough to share meals with two other couples where we shared information about our respective countries and stories of our travels. It was such a relaxing and enjoyable place to stay. Thanks also to Samir who welcomed us at the beginning and looked after us in many ways, including guiding us to the local shops to find supplies."

He prepared us an amazing dinner without notice as we arrived late and our kids were too tired to go to a restaurant. Only comment is that you will need a car, as there is not much around at walking distance. Nice place for a few days of rest, the climate there is fresh compared to the seaside"

Antonio and his co-host Sammi are model hosts: friendly, punctual, knowledgeable of the area, and easy to talk to. The breakfasts with homemade jams, fresh bread and fresh fruit from the garden were a delight. We also spent a day in Palermo with Antonio and Sammi as our guides which was fantastic. I  wholeheartedly recommend staying at Antonio's house!\n\n"

For those who plan to cook in, be prepared to be resourceful. The bathroom is down a narrow spiral case stairway. \n\nSit on the patio and watch the hustle and bustle of tourists, boats and cars from 8 am - 5 pm. Quite busy during the day and quiet during the mornings and evenings. Enjoy the view of the islands and the entire scenery of the bay. Lots of places to eat, Dardin was our favorite. If you're lucky, you'll hear live music floating across the water. \n"

We had one of the best terraces in Imerovigli, the location was stunning and the apartment was just as the photos showed. \n\nEverything was fantastic from the ease of initial communication with Stefanos while making our booking to the fantastic welcome we reviewed by Yannis and Zachos  - who kindly carried my bag to the apartment! \n\nStefanos and Yannis provided very detailed information on how to get to Imerovigli from the airport, giving us different options depending on budget. We chose to take the airport transfer arranged by Yannis and it was very smooth. Yannis provided a fantastic welcome and showed us around the apartment and gave us tips on places to go around the island. There was even a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us which we greatly appreciated! \n\nThe apartment is simple and comfortable. We felt very at home there. In our opinion, although Fira and Oia are bigger and there is much more going on, Imerovigli is the loveliest of the three towns on that side of the island. It was quiet and tranquil but within very easy reach of Fira - just a 20 walk along a lovely path the a short bus ride to Oia. There is no need to go to Oia for sunset - Blue Note restaurant in Imerovigli is perfect to view it! \n\nImerovigli is a very friendly place, be sure to visit Avocado for fantastic food and the best service we experienced and the bar at the Altana boutique hotel for the best drinks ever! \n\nCheck out was just as smooth as arrival and we were sad to leave. \n\nThank you to Stefanos, Yannis and Zachos for everything, it was wonderful and we hope we can visit again sometime! \n\nBest wishes\n\nCaroline & Neil Mathers \n\n\n"

The city of Lecce is well worth visiting if you are travelling around the region, and Gianluca's house offers the perfect base. On top of that, he was extremely welcoming, providing us with tips for where to eat and what to see, and even sorting out parking for us. We would thoroughly recommend!"

The apartment is amazing everything that you need and feels like home. Gianluca is an absolute legend, he met us at the bus station and took us to the apartment and showed us everything and gave us advice about Lecce. He then went above and beyond when I realised I had left my camera bag on the bus and tracked it down for me, picked it up and returned it back to the apartment. He also drove us back to the airport when we left as the buses were either to early or to late. A beautiful apartment  in a beautiful place."

This is my second time here, and forgetting the paint smell that was a bit of an downer the first few nights, I'm looking forward to coming back again if it works out. When I remember my vacation from Greece, this place is where my memories drift back to. It is simple but pure bliss and beauty. I hope to visit again soon. Also, the woman who cleans is very nice and does great work cleaning everything. This place is a dream come true. "

The only thing that wasn't working so well as the wifi, but not sure if that was a problem somehow with my phone or not. Mostly the wifi worked okay on my laptop. The porter helped with my bags, which really was good and meant I didn't get lost trying to find the place. The woman who made breakfest was so kind and sweet. She really was nice and I enjoyed the simple breakfest. But mostly: the view! The fact that all this space is yours alone. You look above you and see so many people crowding and you have 2 balcony spaces to yourself, a pool, and the best view on the island. This place really is Paradise. The design inside in chic and clean, very nice arranged details. Everything needed and a fruit basket as well. I really hope to stay here again one day, as this place calmed me in a way I haven't been in a long time. Cheers for Panos and all the help from the others. "

Panos is also an amazing host, doing whatever he can to ensure you have a great time and make any arrangements you might need. The suite itself is so cute and clean, also!"

I am so happy that we did! It was the best location for the sunset every night, easily walkable to lots of great little restaurants and shops, and the home was exquisite. I would highly suggest booking the transfer to and from the airport as well as the Porter with Panos, as getting up and down the stairs luggage would have been really tricky.\n\nThe Jacuzzi was lovely, and breakfast every morning was a wonderful treat!"

Pietro is a generous exceptional person, showed us the way to the house spent time with us and basically let us feel at home away from home, sharing his home grown vegetables, tips around the neighbourhood and places worth visit... The house is no different, it was designed as a team house, very warm and welcoming with everything you could think of. utterly fantastic in every sense of the word. I guess one thing I am not sure people wrote before in older reviews is the fact that this fairytale of a place is just an hour from Rome, which makes it even more accessible and easier to visit. I would love to visit again, hopefully soon"

You feel like you have stepped into a storybook, my family and I were speechless trying to take in all the custom woodworking and tile work. I feel like I was able to leave the world behind and truly relax . Pietro was so kind he greeted us with a big smile and welcomed us on to his veranda for champagne and sweets. Then so we did not have to go back to town he cut fresh veggies out of his garden so we could enjoy a delicious salad . This is the most amazing place I have ever booked . If you book this place you will definitely make memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you Pietro from the bottom of my heart."

It's close to Florence but far enough to switch of from a busy daily routine and soak up the beautiful countryside of Tuscany. The whole area is very well kept with many details that make you fall in love over and over again with the property of Villa Barthel. We enjoyed as well the pool and tennis court. Everything is well organized an Teresa was very kind and helpful at the reception. The treehouse just beats it all up! It's so so so nice and in the evening even more I would say. I woke up in the middle of the night and could not believe how lucky I was for this experience. It's pricy but absolutely worth the experience. I will go back for sure one day soon!"

We arrived just in time for dinner, which was just fantastic! it was a 3 course meal, which was served at the big table in the dinning room. The place has an honesty bar where you help yourself to any of the great selection of drinks and pay for it at the end of the stay, which is a brilliant idea. \nWe stayed in Greystock room and it was huge and beautiful. The big fluffy towel and the bath robes were a really nice touch. Breakfast again was simply delicious and you have a great variety of options you can choose from. The castle is just like a museum with the exception that you can walk anywhere you want and they also have a great library with a lot of old books. Simon and Wendy did a great job decorating this place, really good taste and really makes you feel like royalty. Also fantastic staff! I hope I didn't miss anything. would love to come back."

The castle is quite small which makes it feel cozy and magestic at the same time. The dinners with everyone also encouraged guests to be friendly which I thought was wonderful. It's a fantastic place and I will certainly be coming again."

Bathrooms are very big and nicely done. Cleanliness is excellent. Next up is the location. Very convenient to most major attractions and has the ideal combination of quiet and liveliness. There are many restaurants right in the neighborhood that we dined at. Lastly, Mar was very helpful and we enjoyed talking to her. Highly recommended. "

Be sure to take a ferry ride over to the island of Montisola also!\n\n For those of you visiting in the summer, please know that it gets hot there and there is no air conditioner. The fans helped as did the fantastic swimming pool, but it was still 31c in the apartment in the evenings.  However, overall, we would definitely stay there again, just maybe in the spring or fall when the weather was cooler. "

The pool, tennis court and french boules area is lovely, and it's a very short walk into a small town with everything you need.\n\nOur suggestion is to get dinner 250m up the hill at a lovely Italian restaurant, we had spaghetti and then pizza's to go... we were very full, but very satisfied.

We had hoped to find some relaxation and actually found a piece of paradise. You have a wonderful garden full of flowers and a little brook burbling along the cabin - the perfect romantic idyll for a couple in love. We always felt safe and sound and unobserved in spite of the big windows. On the contrary - we enjoyed the beautiful sun and moon-view and the spectecular garden surrounding the cabin. The oven gave us a feeling of cosiness on highest level. You as hosts were very friendly, discrete and well organised. Thank you very much for opening your special garden house for us. And thank you as well for offering us your bikes. So we could discover the region around Ermelo - such as the Heideland and its honey scent. "

Every morning Mr. Cora made us the best breakfast ever- homemade bread, pancakes, jam, coffee, bruschettes, everything fresh and baked. They gave us reccommendation about places to visit. This whole area is really beautiful. The lake, the nature, activities, restorans and bars. There are things to do on the lake, and, on the other hand, it's not too crowded anywhere. Nights in the House on the lake are so quite and the air is so fresh - so, for the people who want escape from the daily routines and city noise, it's really a perfect place.

Jean Luc provided us with a photo of the yurt's location to help us get there without issues.  The yurt was super secluded and great placed to get away and enjoy great views of the Alps.  The yurt has all the basic necessities for simply life living.  Recommend to all travelers willing to get away from the traditional hotel experience."

                "description": "As some of the previous reviews have said this is a great property in a very quiet area on the outskirts of Labenne. We particularly liked the large deck, which always had shaded areas even on the sunniest days, and the wifi coverage - which was excellent. The pool was slightly smaller than we expected but it was more than adequate. We liked the fact that it was one depth (4.5 feet) throughout. The house is quite a distance from both the beach and the local shops so we had to drive to both.\n\nAgn√®s and Fred were great hosts. They always replied very promptly and sent some very helpful suggestions for local markets and things to do. The property manager (Nadia) was very efficient and after check-in she emailed a detailed inventory which included the things that weren't working and needed to be fixed. These included a broken shutter (which was fixed during our stay) and the automatic open/close mechanism for the gate.\n\nAll in all we had a great week and we would definitely recommend this property."

There's some lovely places to cycle along side the waterways and we felt safe on the cycle tracks. We drove to Bayonne which is beautiful. The villa is superb and very cosy with everything you need. Nadia was great and Agnes was very informative sending us lots of info before we arrived and messaged us while we were there to see how we were finding the villa which was lovely. The bottle of champagne in the fridge was perfect when we arrived after a long drive from England. We will definitely be back!! We ate well, drank well and slept well :-) "

Black Forest is nearby: 20 min by car to Mummelsee (Lake), Mehliskopf (Mountain) and many possibilities to discover nature. Some good restaurants nearby - so you can taste the local wine and walk back. In the neighborhood: the local wine society with shop with wine testing. ",

We arrived on Mother's Day and Monika and her family gave us the warmest welcome. Their beautiful dog, Lassie, loves to say hello and enjoys a pet or two. Having parking on-site was very convenient as we had a car. We just wish we had more than just a day there. "

The night after we stayed at the Sheratton in Stuttgart and lets say Monika's place was two stars up from Sheratton's room. The breakfast was delicious with many options, they even offered honey from they're daughter's production. I highly recommend this place. We plan to stay here again as we will visit my daughter who decided to go to Uni Tubingen in the Fall."

Everything exceeded my imagination. \nKerri-Lea was a wonderful host, the check in and check out was easy.\nThe Villa and pool/BBQ area is all well equipped. A wonderful place to stay, relax and take in the serenity.

Gerry and Jeannette were still waiting up when two frazzled travellers arrived. They were calm and helpful at all times. They have a lovely house on the water front and are charming hosts. Just a warning to other travellers to watch the high kerb driving in -if you hit the wrong place you could damage your car. No permanent damage to ours, luckily, and Gerry was very helpful in that regard too. Highly recommended to other travellers."

While their home is far from the city center (renting a car is highly recommended as Auckland is very big city), you won't regret staying with them. I couldn't think of a more beautiful spot that is peaceful and overlooking the city and harbor. More importantly, both of them embody what hosting should be. They ensured that our stay was comfortable and were attentive even to the little details. Jeanette prepared wonderful breakfast everyday and we enjoyed talking with them, sharing our views and backgrounds. Lastly, they gave us a lot of tips and suggestions to help us navigate around Auckland. I would definitely stay with them again should I ever visit Auckland in the future!"

We had the pleasure to stay for an entire week. Our 6 year old son totally loved it. In the morning we were woken up by the sun that shone into the yurt and kind of kissed us awake. Taking a warm shower in the open bathroom (with 9 degrees Celcius outside) and making dinner in the open kitchen during a little storm added to the adventure. Tessa, Remko and the kids were absolutely lovely and shared their experiences and parts of their journey with us. We also got great tipps how to explore in the region. Highly, highly recommended."

We spent two nights there and during the day we didn't even leave - we just relaxed and read our books to the sounds of nature. Their home is nestled between green tea fields, a bamboo forest, and a gushing river.  Both the dinner and breakfast they made for us were fresh and delicious, made with local ingredients - some made by their neighbors, like the honey, cheese, and tea. We came with so many questions after 2 weeks in the Japanese countryside, and Hila happily answered all of them. We would definitely come back!!"

His authentic home is comfortable and enchanting, while the surroundings are serene with plenty of exploring to do nearby. Our only regret is that we didn't have more time to spend up there and that Hila wasn't around while we were staying.  I am counting on returning some time in the future to really chill and hopefully meet her, too (they live on the same property just next door). While fairly outback and up in the hilly, more remote countryside, the car navigator brought us to the door, just be sure someone types the accurate address in Japanese (driving instructions are voiced in English).

Hila came by every morning to chat and make sure we had everything we needed, but otherwise we were left alone to enjoy the house and its surrounds. Everything was simply perfect; if you're looking to experience rural Japan in a singular way, I would definitely recommend Dai & Hila's place. \n** N.B. - beware spiders and creepy-crawlies!! We're Australian, so we didn't have much trouble with them, but if you're not a fan of many-legged creatures, Shizuoka's countryside might not be the place for you! **"

For location, it is just between the forest and the village, which ensure the safety of the cottage as well as provide excellent scenery of the countryside. The cottage was warm and quiet. The host is very warm-hearted, taking us from the railway station way up to the cottage, introducing specifically how to use every detail of using the house. Villagers are very welcome, a villager even drove us around the village just because we did not know where the shrine was. The host also drove us to the hot spring in the local town and introduced us with several recommended restaurants around that place. Food was overall great and as there is a big supermarket with all kinds of food and necessities, and that the cottage itself has all the equipment needed to cook, the food can also be prepared by guests themselves. \n\nAs a traveler who has never been to Japan before and for most of the time lived in the urban areas, the cottage, together with the Japanese-style countryside living experience, was really impressive for me. I appreciated the beauty of nature in this village and also experienced the local culture. It was an unforgettable part of my Japanese trip!"

There was some construction equipment nearby, so I wonder if more cottages are being built.  Please, if you go (and you should go), watch out for the little black and white kitten.  She is very loving and very hungry.  It seems she does not belong to anyone.  If I had known about her before arriving, I would have picked up some food at the supermarket.  As it was, I gave her cheese, the insides of my gyoza, tofu skin and some of my bottled water.  Please pick up some cans of food when you visit. I regret that I was unable to take her to a rescue group or vet during my short stay (I only met her in the afternoon of my one day there), so if you have the opportunity, please do.\n\nI have already recommended the cottage to my Japanese and American friends and I would love to go back and explore.  I spent my day inside, as it was raining, but thoroughly enjoyed myself by coloring in the guest book at the desk and looking out the window.  I'm inspired to build my own back in California. :)"

We built campfire (with extreme cautious) and enjoyed the astonishing night sky full of stars. This is the place for nature lover. Since it's in the wild, some inconvenience or little insects are unavoidable, this is no cozy hotel in the city, but an experience you should try."

Downstairs is an adorable cafe that serves some seriously tasty coffee and whiskey. It's in a very convenient location, about a 6 minute walk to the nearest JR Station, and a quick train ride to Kyoto Station. Kojiro and Seanacey are so kind and helpful, they did everything they could to make us feel welcome. In short, if you really want a great experience and to step back in time (with modern conveniences) stay here! "

The stairwell in the house is a little steep, however you have the option of sleeping either upstairs or downstairs so it's not a big problem at all. Everything is well furbished and extremely welcoming. If I'm ever in Kyoto again I'll be sure to come back. Thanks!"

We stayed at another Airbnb in Kyoto for 6 nights prior, and while that studio was great, it made us appreciate how spacious and nice Alfie's place is even more. The bed was comfy and our bedroom had plenty of space. We had a fancy Japanese toilet right next to our room (my boyfriend was obsessed with it) and they provided coffee/tea and fruit & pastries for breakfast each morning which was wonderful. It's close enough to the subway stations & major train lines to feel centrally located, but the neighborhood is wonderfully residential and quiet. We realized that the trains stop running fairly early each night (we usually needed to catch the last train back by 12:30am), so if you plan to party late into the night, you may need to find someplace closer to the nightlife action. There are plenty of shops & restaurants nearby Alfie's place though, including a 7-Eleven just a couple blocks away."

They had great instructions and suggestions on which passes to buy for our stay and gave great instructions on how to get from the airport to the airbnb. This was very helpful to us as the Tokyo metro system was overwhelming initially! The Tokyo subway pass does not cover a small section between the station by the airbnb and the main subway system (about 160 yen extra everytime we travelled that section), but we were still able to make great use of the 3 day pass regardless. There are also many places within walking distance to get food and it is great to take some time to explore the surrounding area. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and this location is a good value!"

Warm, comfortable, friendly, engaged.\n\nIt will be a great joy to return."

We appreciate how you guys have involved us in everything - art events, yoga (too bad we've missed that), and the homemade breakfast that had made our day. \n\nMy personal favourite is finding everyone at the dining table when we came back, discussing the creative projects being worked on, with toothbrushes in the mouths. We appreciate all the recommendations you guys have given, and every little detail (from the morning music to the flyers to art events in the washroom to the little worms that generate natural fertilizers) has made our vacation exceptionally unforgettable. \n\nWe surely hope to return in the near future, if you let us :) And I'm already missing little Miss Sola!

It helps one immerse into the local atmosphere of cafes and shops, offers a walk along the river and challenges  to negotiate the local metro/train system. Try out a local hot spring place which is only about 15 minute walk from the house. What a great experience!\n\nThe house was clean and comfortable. Communication with K&N was very efficient. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. We forgot our glasses on departure for Kyoto. K&N very kindly sent them to our address in our new home there. What an amazing gesture!\n\nThank you K&N. We would certainly stay again and recommend this place to anyone with an adventurous streak in them ;-) \n"

With so many places to choose from in Kyoto, we decided to splurge a little and stay here for 3 nights, and it was definitely worth it. Excellent location right near a beautiful little river, tons of shops and restaurants nearby, close to main tourist attractions but also quiet and removed enough that you feel like a local. The experience embodied everything I hope for in an Airbnb, and I hope to return again. Seiko was even kind enough to call us a cab on our departure, she was always quick to help and as kind as can be. "

The stairs are quite steep, but we didn't have a problem with them. There's plenty of additional padding if you aren't used to sleeping on the floor (like me). Seiko let us drop our bags off early, and she showed us around the home personally. It was so nice of her! The location is great, close to bus stops, and a 15 minute walk to the major train station. It's a quiet residential area, which is a little further from the busy part of Kyoto with shops and restaurants, but that's what we were looking for. It felt like home to us. Thank you again Seiko!"

Our host was very easy to communicate with, connected with us via we chat straight after booking with the address and detailed instructions for how to access the flat. \n\nUnfortunately, a few hiccups with checking in. We asked if we could drop our bags off at 1pm. Our host agreed, but we couldn't actually check in until 3pm as the flat needed to be cleaned. We ended up arriving around 3pm anyway but found that the cleaner was still there, and didn't finish until almost quarter to 4. This was annoying as we were extremely jet lagged and were hoping to get some rest before dinner. The bedsheets had also not been dried properly due to the lack of time so they were still damp on the bed for the first night.\n\nOne thing that bothered us was although the garden gate locked, we couldn't lock the front door of the actual house. Not sure if it was maybe broken but we felt a bit insecure leaving the house! Luckily nothing happened but people could easily hop over the fence and break in. "

They sent clear diectuons so we didn't have any trouble figuring out how to get there from the train station. Andrea met us at the bus stop and spent a long time orienting us to the apartment and the city. He provided nice recommendations on where to eat and how to get to the local sites easily. \nThe apartment location is great and we loved sitting out on the small balcony over the sweet little stream. The description online is accurate, but to be clear this is a traditional Japanese home with two rooms and futons for sleeping on the floor. We loved the experience if staying in a traditional apartment. \nWould definitely recommend this place if you can get a booking! "

                "description": "This house is absolutely breathtaking! It was our first time visiting Japan and staying in a traditional tatami house was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.\n\nThe house is a very old house, apparently about 70 years old, but it is well maintained and well loved. Although it was very different that the Canadian homes we're used to, it felt familiar and homely after setting foot in the door.\n\nOur favourite part of this house was the 2 bikes that are included in the rental. This made commuting to the subway (3-5 minute bike ride) so much quicker, and we even cooked a meal on a couple of nights since the baskets on the bikes allowed us to carry groceries home.\n\nMariko was extremely helpful and a wonderful host. Upon arriving, we found a letter wishing us a good stay, along with a small gift. She left many pamphlets and guide books in case we needed to find something to do in Osaka, and was quick with her replies when we messaged her.\n\nOne of the main reasons we decided to stay in Osaka was so that we could dedicate one of our meals to eating the renowned Kobe Beef. Unfortunately, many of the top rated restaurants we wanted to make a reservation at didn't have websites available in English. We contacted Mariko and she happily assisted us in calling the restaurant to book a reservation. Upon discovering that the restaurant was closed on the day we were hoping to book, she found another restaurant for us and made the reservation! It was one of the best meals we've ever had, and we have Mariko to thank for helping us get there.\n\nThe house itself is located just across from an elementary school where we could hear the school bell chime between periods, and there were many families in the area. We felt very safe and very comfortable.\n\nOne thing you HAVE to do is visit the fried food shop that Mariko recommends in her instructions - we bought some tempura shrimp, octopus, and croquettes, and they were so delicious that we went back for seconds!\n\nThere is a supermarket and cheesecake store nearby, and being so close to the subway (10-minute walk) was great.\n\nAll in all, a great trip in a BEAUTIFUL house, provided by an amazing host. We'd recommend to anyone!"

Also Tom communicates clearly and prompt. \n\nFor 2-3 people the place is fine, but certainly not for more people as it is tiny (not small, tiny). \n\nThe overall state of the house is OK, but not great. It needs a lot of TLC and some deco to feel comfortable. Most important it was not clean - dirty black hairs everywhere. Even the washing machine was dirty on the inside. \n\nThe house is heavily used in a highly commercial way, and it shows. \n\nNeedless to say it was not our best Airbnb experience... "

They are super friendly and lovel, definitely enlighten my trip! The place is close to BTS( skyline subway), probably take 5 mins to walk there. And this is a great neighborhood, you can even find some decent local vendors when you walk in/out. And the breakfast the host made is amazing too. I would definitely stay again if I came to Bangkok the next time! "

We walked to the MBK center, which is a huge mall, in about an hour. The walking isn't bad at all because there is always so much activity on the street. The famous sky bar is only a short 15 minute walk away. Bee's father was also very helpful, he saved us a ton of money by telling us the best way to get to our next location. The place is so cute and cozy. I would recommend staying here"

Not only that the company was pleasant, but the the meal that the young chef, Rachel Karasik prepared was nothing but delicious.\r\nThe guest room was spacious, clean and tidy, fully equipped kitchenette with all the necessary tools for cooking. The bathroom was large and included shower and bath. There were many other goodies in the apartment which made our stay most comfortable.\r\nThe apartment centrally located with many subway lines, buses and EuroStar. Easy access within minutes to main attractions.\r\nPeter's place is far and beyond a 5* hotel and definitely we shell be back. "

We lived into the guest room on June 6, when the terrorist attack happened, we were sleeping in the apartment after exhausting wedding photography in the daytime. When I woke up in the middle of the night, I received Peter's message asking whether we are OK.\nThe apartment is fabulous. St. Pancras tower itself is an amazing architecture, just can't believe we live in it.\nAt first I wanted to book the master room but it was already booked. The guest room is also great, my husband likes it even more. It has a small kitchen and clean bathroom. My husband's toenail was hurt so we had to stay in the apartment most of the time during 3 days. It feels like home.\nOh the location of the apartment can't be better. Very close to the king cross station and the library of London, one mile away from the British museum. Bus stop and subway station are just super close to the building. Love it!"

We just stayed one night and, being local, were able to bring some food to eat in and share with a couple of friends.\n\nWe stayed in the Guest Suite which is, as the description says, a large studio flat which takes up half of the lower floor of the larger apartment. The Guest Suite has its own kitchen and table that easily seats four people. There is a double bed and a sofa bed/seating area with TV, and it has its own bathroom.\n\nWe were free to roam around the rest of the apartment (excepting the master bedroom which was also booked) and enjoyed sitting in the clock tower room on the upper floor with its double (treble? quadruple?) height ceiling and views out into area around King's Cross. \n\nWe could have used the main kitchen/dining space on the upper floor for our meal as there was nobody else around for most of the time we were there but the Guest Suite was just fine for our purposes.\n\nWe would recommend Peter's apartment to anybody visiting London. It is very comfortable (it is five stories above the noise of the streets), is in a great location (particularly if you are arriving at St Pancras or King's Cross!) and the area has great facilities (try the Spiritland Bar for some cool music).\n \nAlex and Gail"

But one thing at night time is a bit of walking distance and also need to pass through some quiet places when walk back home in the night time from both Barons court or Hammersmith station (12 to 15 mins walk), as the quickest way of Baron's court is being closed in the evening time, so need to walk a bit further more.  \n\nVicky is a very good and nice host,  quite helpful and detailed minded, she will provide you many information before your trip and also caring for us attentively. \nHowever,  we have not much time to meet each other as she is also out for vacation a few days during our 6 days stay , otherwise I think we can talk to each other a lot. \n\nThanks Vicky"

An intelligent, thoughtful, and tidy hostess who was very generous and also knowledgeable about where to eat - Thanks Vicky, Poppies Thai food was like Alice In Wonderland with Great Thai food! The near by cemetery and quick walk to Barons Court Station made this an easy stay. Also, there are some great shops right near by if one is keen to do some shopping for groceries, fashion clothing, stationary, you name it. This area was safe to stroll in, so bring your walking shoes. Our favorite near-by museum to visit was the house of the famous Pre-Raphielate Brotherhood Artist Sir Frederick Leighton. This was a real treasure and only a 25 minute stroll from Vicki's with lots to see on the way. We hope to see Vicky again, ~ Cheers! "

The appt is as nicer or even nicer than what it looks in the pics, with everything  you need including wifi etc. \r\nWill was great, very helpful and considerate of my late check in (around 22:00).\r\nOverall - a highly recommended stay!\r\n\r\n"

This flat is 5min away from Kensington station but it took me 40min to get to this flat eventually with the help of nice lady. ha ha! \nAnyway, I enjoyed myself during staying at Will & Emilia's flat.

We enjoyed our stay and the flat's location is ideal for London sightseeing. "
